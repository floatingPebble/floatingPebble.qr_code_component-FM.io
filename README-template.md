## My process

I started with the layout in HTML. Didn't want to assign a class to everything since it's a small project. As for CSS, went from the global variables and body element all the way down to styling the child components. Also, I figured that there is no need for a @media query. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS global variables
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Actually, I am using these beginner tasks to brush up on my rusty web dev knowledge, but I did take a new approach with the styling, starting from the top parent element and going down the scope, and for the first time I used CSS global variables.

### Continued development

Nothing specific. I will tackle all of these tasks starting from the easiest. My goal is to simulate the real web dev job flow with all the ups and downs.
